# Stage-3 inventory — every single-human datum the sim carries

Read-only sweep of the working tree at 32f1c0b + uncommitted edits (10-10). All paths are relative to
`/home/rain/projects/mgcarpet/crates/mgc-sim/src/` unless stated. Line numbers were read from the files.

**Classes**
- **P** PER-SEAT — real per-human state; needs one copy per human seat.
- **R** DERIVABLE-FROM-RECORD — duplicates bytes that are (or belong) on the human's class-3 record; the record field is named.
- **G** GLOBAL — stays single (world-global, config, retail globals, presentation for the local viewer).
- **T** TRANSPORT — a writer→drain mailbox between world walkers and the human's flight drive/wizard pass.

**Counts** are `grep -o` hits, shown as `sim src / sim tests / other crates (app+conform+render+import)`, pattern `\.field\b`
(or `player\.field\b` for `Player`). They include the declaration, snapshot codec (`snap_write`/`snap_apply`), hash
destructure and in-file unit tests, so read them as an upper bound on logic sites. Names marked ⚠noisy share a
spelling with unrelated fields (e.g. `.kills`, `.stats`, `.completed`, `.duel`), so their counts are high.

Record-field shorthand: `x/y/z`, `f30` = +30 heading (MC2 `yaw_0x1C_28` lives at the same port field), `f32` = +32
pitch (MC2 @0x20 `roll_0x20_32`), `act_life` (+12), `max_life` (+8), `f136` (+136 ceiling), `f140` (+140 purse),
`tick70` (+70 state / MC2 action), `flags` (+16/+17 as a u32: 0x20 invisible, 0x300 hands, 0x4000 shield (+17 0x40),
0x8000 rebound (+17 0x80), 0x1000 shrine (+17 0x10)), `mail`, `next20/prev22` (+20/+22 chain links),
`f38` (+38 killer), `f46`, `f63` (tick counter), `f126` (+126 actual speed), `rand` (+4 entity LCG),
`f26` (MC2 `dword_0x10_16`).

What `World::mirror_human_record` (engine/world.rs:7928) writes today, FROM the registers:
`x,y,z ← human_pose`; `f30,f32 ← mc1_cast_pose.heading/pitch` (MC1) or `human_yaw` + the record's own `f32` (MC2);
`max_life ← PLAYER_LIFE_MAX`; `act_life ← player.life`; `f136 ← player.mana_max`; `f140 ← player.mana`;
`tick70 ← player.state` (0/2/3; 12 while `mc2_endseq`); `flags & (0x20|0x300|0x8000) ← hand_bits, player.invisible||ghost, player.rebound`.
Everything else on the record is not written by the mirror. Mail is the one datum already moved: `Gen::pmail()/pmail_mut()`
(engine/features.rs:6757/6765) return `ent[human_rec].mail` when `human_mail_home()` (:6745) holds.

## 3. `Gen` single-human fields (engine/features.rs, struct at :1127)

Gen is `#[derive(Hash)]`. Any new or reshaped field needs a hash opt-out, so per-seat versions must follow the `HashSilent`/manual-Hash pattern.

## 4. `MobCtx` (mc1/mobs.rs:289)

The doc comment calls it "the wizard list of the original, reduced to the one human player". Built in production at
engine/world.rs:8907 (`tick_inner`, from the `player: PlayerPose` arg + `self.player.mana/mana_max/life`). It is
re-published mid-walk by `adopt_walk_pose` (:7889), which also re-stamps `human_pose`, relinks `player_chain` and calls
`mirror_human_record`. The wake variant is at :9296/:9312, with px/py from `mc2_wake_pose` (:8438). The load-time MC2
probe (:19518) uses the **first authored start marker**. 7 further non-test literals live in world.rs tests and module tests.

| Field | Def | Meaning | Class | Record home | `ctx.field` refs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `px`/`py`/`pz` | :290-292 | human pose (mid-walk phase) | **R** | record x/y/z | 116 / 115 / 74 |
| `pyaw` | :296 | human heading | **R** | `f30` | 21 |
| `pmana` | :299 | purse | **R** | `f140` | 6 |
| `pmana_max` | :305 | ceiling | **R** | `f136` | 4 |
| `pdead` | :311 | live "dead or falling" (life < 0) | **R** | `act_life < 0` | 43 |
| `pdead_top` | :316 | tick-top pdead | **R** | record membership at the chain build | 13 |
| `strict`/`patches`/`mc2_turn` | :321/:325/:334 | config / turn | **G** | | — |

The key fact for stage 3: all ~390 `ctx.p*` reads assume one target. With N humans each reader has to either walk the
class-3 chain and meet each human at his record (the stage-2 `chain_human` route) or take a seat argument. The record
already holds every one of these bytes once it is mirrored at the walk slot.

## 5. Flight state in `Simulation` (lib.rs:398) + `flight.rs`

`Simulation::step(&mut self, input: &FlightInput)` (lib.rs:723) → `World::tick(player: PlayerPose, cmd: PlayerCommand)`
(world.rs:8126) / `tick_inner(player, cmd, drive: Option<&mut FlightDrive>, post)` (:8455). `FlightDrive` (world.rs:661)
borrows `&mut Mc1State` + `Mc1Input` + `Mc2Drive{ext, accel_was_active}` + the `CarpetPropel` kernel. All of it is one human.

## 6. Transport channels (T): writer → drain

All of them have to become per-seat, or target a record slot. The **writer** column is the world walker and the
**drain** column is the human's dispatch. Every drain sits in `step_player_flight` (MC1, world.rs ~7600-7740),
`step_player_flight_mc2` (~7220-7470), `mc2_carpet_dispatch` (~5660-5900), `tick_inner` tail, or `Simulation::step`.

## 7. LOCAL / SEAT-0 retail leaks (from `multiplayer-step1-seat-k-research-2026-10-10.md`)

Keying today: **single** = reads the one human (`human_tag` / `human_pose` / `ctx` / `self.player` / `mc2_book`), so it is
seat-correct for 1 human at any seat but not N-ready. **seat** = `human_seat`. **0** = literal seat 0.

| # | Retail leak | Port site | Keyed to | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | MC1 wake pass `sub_54F00` (SP only) | `Gen::mob_awake_pass` mc1/mobs.rs:4560, gate at :4580 (`dist2_sq(e, ctx.px/py)`); called world.rs:9328 with `wake_ctx` (:9296) | single | Retail MP skips the pass (memory ruling: MP = all awake). The port has no MP switch yet; the `awake_range 0` option exists |
| 2 | MC1 total-mana seed `sub_48230` (u32_188 = local human's u32_322) | `World::recompute_mana` world.rs:16115, seed :16161 | constant | seeds `WIZARD_BASE_MANA` (1000) / MC2 1 — not keyed to anyone. The total lives on `Player::world_mana` (misplaced G) |
| 3 | MC1 `sub_59B80` win trigger reads `str_13323[0]` | trigger state 4, world.rs:22412 (`self.completed && self.player_castle_bound()`) | single | `completed` / `win_streak` / `castle_reg` per human. Retail reads block 0 hardwired, so a seat-k human's latch is ignored in retail. The port reads the human's, i.e. it is already "fixed" |
| 4 | MC1 cheat heal `actLife = var_u16_8` | engine/world/cheats.rs:107-108 `self.player.life = PLAYER_LIFE_MAX` | single | Discrepancy: the port writes FULL life (comment ":48993 — actLife = <full>"); the memory says retail writes the local index. Not re-checked against remc1 |
| 5 | MC2 SP objectives seat 0 (EF:40980) | `objective_mc2` world.rs:20246: type 0 uses `player_castle()`, `g.banked_houses`, `player.world_mana` (:20365); type 5 `human_pose` (:20378); type 3 **`color != 0`** guard (world.rs:20423); type 8 checks only `mc2_rivals` | single, plus **0** for type 3 | `color != 0` is a literal seat-0 assumption (target color 0 = the human); wrong at seat k. MP has no objectives (ruling) |
| 6 | MC2 cave-drip seat 0 (EF:40758) | `tick_inner` world.rs:9348 (probe from `player`/`human_pose_prev`/`human_yaw_prev`, 2560 ahead) | single | the cave ambient sound (world.rs:~23882) tags `human_tag` |
| 7 | MC2 doomsday boss target | mc2/doomsday.rs: `f146 = human_tag` :762, `id24 = human_tag` :866/:972, `mc2_danger_poke(human_tag)` :671, `player_castle()` :1064/:1185, `ctx.pdead` gate :1559, hurl/knock :1700/:1711 | single | |
| 8 | MC2 scroll XP | `mc2_class14_tick` scroll collect world.rs:21640-21656 (`player_overlap` + `mc2_award_xp(human_tag, s, 4)` at :21656), `Gen::mc2_scrolls` | single | |
| 9 | MC2 spell level-up `sub_6DB50` / `sub_6D8B0` | `World::mc2_award_xp` mc2/cast.rs:2528 (`owner != human_tag` ⇒ return), `mc2_relevel` mc2/cast.rs:2457 on the single `mc2_book` | single | needs a per-seat book keyed by owner tag |
| 10 | MC2 rain XP flood (`sub_32CF0`, LOCAL player) | `mc2_summit91_tick` mc2/morph.rs:883 → `mc2_cast_xp.push((human_tag, s, amt))` | single | retail pays the LOCAL player only, which would desync in retail MP |
| 11 | Kill credit | MC2 rival death mc2/rivals.rs:10221-10223 **`if k == 0 { g.kills += 1 }`**; MC1 mc1/rivals.rs:6540 **`k == 0`** (kill-switch arm only); `kill_tally` human write world.rs:13088 uses `human_seat`; creature kills mc1/mobs.rs:3855 / mc2/mobs.rs:2163 / mc2/roster.rs:6040 key on `human_tag` | **0** (rival→`g.kills`), seat (tally), single (creatures) | the MC2 `k == 0` is a live seat-0 hardwire: at seat k the human's rival kills go uncounted and seat-0 AI kills are credited to the human |
| 12 | Fly-assistant + barrel-roll local mouse reads | fly assistant is app-side: mgc-app/src/config.rs:743/785 (auto-center of the virtual stick → `FlightInput.stick_*`); barrel roll `Simulation::broll` lib.rs:441, `BarrelRoll::tick(bank, input.raw_dx)` flight.rs:1306, called lib.rs:1031 | single (per FlightInput) | fine as per-seat input once `step(&[FlightInput])` |
| 13 | Hidden latch `byte_0xc & 1` (EF:55832) | `mc2_awake_pass` mc2/mobs.rs:6551, hidden skip :6664 (`flags & 1`), proximity :6681 (`ctx.px/py`) | bit = per-entity; proximity = single | EF:55832 is `sub_68C70` (remc2 EventsFunctions.cpp): the `byte[0]&1` test is on the CREATURE, and the LOCAL read is `array_0x2BDE[LevelIndex].playerIndex`'s position. The leak is the pose, not the bit |
| 14 | `paletteSubMod` end drift | `mc2_end_tick` world.rs:22649 (fade arm ~22815-22831) (fade/creep race modelled as constant one-tick win; `end_fade` :22893) | single (`mc2_endseq`) | retail's fade is a LOCAL palette clock driving sim creep, so it would desync in MP; MP has no level end |
| 15 | Book carry → LevelIndex | app: mgc-app/src/lib.rs:1254-1258 (allowed mask = `wizards[human_seat]`), `campaign_carry` → `World::grant_level_book` world.rs:14510 / `mc2_grant_start_book` mc2/cast.rs:5874 / `mc2_install_selector_carry` mc2/cast.rs:2795 | seat (mask) / single (book) | |

Extra seat-0 / local-keyed spots found during the sweep (not on the memory list):
- `World::mc2_apply_events` world.rs:19505-19518: the load probe ctx uses `start_markers.iter().flatten().next()`, the FIRST authored marker, not `start_markers[human_seat]` (**0-ish**).
- `pal_flash.arm(3)` mc1/combat.rs:7693 and `snd_player` gate on `own == human_tag` ("local player", retail `sub_44BE0` slot compare). Presentation, but local-keyed.
- conformance shadow export hardwires `wiz_charge[0]` (engine/world/conformance.rs:1539, :1682) and `rival_ents[0] = 0` (:847). Conformance is always seat 0, so harmless for now.
- mc1/rivals.rs:1648 falls back to `start_markers[0]` (kill-switch arm only); :1662 seat-0 rival sprite 44 is intended.
- `hate_team_of_tag` default team and `owner_team(..).unwrap_or(0)` are kept literal 0 BY RULING (memory).
- `Player::lost` / `pending_restart`: SP-only castle-less restart, keyed to the single human.

---

## 8. Statics / process-global state touching the human

- `crate::DEBUG_TICK` (lib.rs:37): debug only, **G**.
- `mc2::tail::WHIRL_CRANKS` (mc2/tail.rs:408): replay-harness telemetry counting whirlwind cranks handed to THE human carpet; must become per-seat or seat-filtered if the MC2 replay driver ever runs N humans. Not read by sim logic.
- `TAKE_VOLCANO_GUARD` (features.rs:110): per-process take flag, **G**.
- About 300 other `OnceLock<bool>` env kill switches, including the stage-1/2 switches `MGC_NO_HUMAN_SLOT_TAG`, `MGC_NO_HUMAN_RECORD_MIRROR`, `MGC_NO_HUMAN_MAIL_IN_RECORD`, `human_seat_at_record`, `human_area_at_record`, `human_on_wiz_chain`. These are **G**, but every one hard-codes the one-human arms they A/B.
- App inputs into the sim, all single-human today: `FlightInput` (local input mapper, virtual stick, fly assistant, strafe-edge barrel roll); `set_mc1_hud_drawn` (local view mode); `set_invincible/ghost/inert/dev_spells`, `weightless`, `set_thrust_model/altitude_model` (local config); `--seat` → `human_seat` (mgc-app/src/lib.rs:1081-1258, `player_start_seat` lib.rs:1563). The app's rival spawn and book mask are already keyed by `human_seat`.

## 9. Size estimate

Distinct data items inventoried (this report's rows; transport helpers and already-per-seat arrays included):

| Class | Count | Biggest |
|---|---|---|
| **P** per-seat | ~86 (Player 20, World 21, Gen 20, Simulation 13, Mc1State 5, Mc2Ext 7) | `mc2_book` (268), `Player` P-fields (≈560 combined refs), `human_tag` (480), `flyer` (204), `Mc1State` P-fields, `human_seat` (96), `carpet slot` regs (105), `player_aggro` (52), `mc1_acq` (62) |
| **R** record-derivable | ~43 (Player 11, World 10, Gen 7, MobCtx 8, Mc1State 7) | `human_pose` (123), `player.life`/`state`/`mana` (≈400), `ctx.p*` (≈390), `Mc1State x/y/z/yaw` (≈450 incl. non-human `s.` hits ⚠noisy), `player_chain` (31), `player_invisible` (31) |
| **G** global | ~37 | `world_mana`, `start_markers`, `kill_tally`, `wiz_charge`, `castle_reg`, config cheats, presentation |
| **T** transport | 15 (+3 Mc2Ext drain slots) | `player_knock` (45, also a decaying register), `pending_teleport` (33), `pending_speed_base` (21), `player_flood_pull` (17) |

Rough site counts:
- **Identity of "the human"**: `human_tag.0` ≈480 + `human_rec/chain_human/human_rides_chain/human_seat_at/pmail*` ≈130 + `human_seat` ≈96 ≈ **700 sites**, mostly mechanical (`== tag` → "is a human tag" / owner→seat lookup).
- **`self.player.*`**: ≈1030 sites. The ≈11 R fields can be served by reads/writes through the record (`ent[rec].f140`, …), which is mechanical once the record is authoritative. The ≈20 P fields need a `players[seat]` block.
- **MobCtx `p*`**: ≈390 reads. Each becomes either a chain-walk meet (stage-2 pattern) or a seat lookup. This is the highest-semantic-risk group, because phase (mid-walk republish vs tick-top) is load-bearing.
- **Flight (`Simulation` + `FlightDrive`)**: ≈60 struct-level sites in lib.rs + world.rs step/dispatch, with `PlayerPose` 311 sites (mostly tests: 108 in sim tests).
- **Transport channels**: ≈180 sites total; ~40 writer sites need to pick a target seat (most writers already have the victim record in hand).
- **mgc-conform / app**: `.player.*` 9, `human_*` ~20, plus the conform shadow seat-0 hardwires. Small.

Order of magnitude: **≈2,300–2,500 touched sites** in mgc-sim (≈60% mechanical renames to a per-seat block or record field;
≈400–500 needing real thought: MobCtx phase readers, transport writer targeting, `mc2_book`/XP owner routing,
objectives/kill credit). This agrees with the 10-10 estimate (≈1000+ with 150–200 real logic) once tests and the
`Player` block are counted.

### Biggest risks
1. **MobCtx phase**: `px/py/pz` are re-published mid-walk at the carpet's slot (`adopt_walk_pose`), `pdead` vs `pdead_top`, and `mc2_wake_pose` peeks the pending respawn. N humans means N walk-slot adoptions in slot order. Getting the phase wrong moves fixtures silently.
2. **`player_knock` is a register, not a mailbox** (decays −4/tick, clamped, cleared by death/respawn) and has 8 writer sites in 6 files. `player_whirl` can survive a tick boundary and accumulates within a walk (`ww_walk_published`).
3. **Hash/snapshot shape**: `Player` has a manual full-destructure Hash with transparent-at-pristine rules; `Gen` derives Hash. Moving to per-seat blocks must keep seat-0 output byte-identical, or the goldens re-pin by design.
4. **Live seat-0 hardwires**: mc2/rivals.rs:10222 `k == 0` kill credit and world.rs:20423 objective `color != 0` are wrong at seat k today. `mc2_apply_events` uses the first marker.
5. **`mc2_book` (268 refs)** + `mc2_award_xp`'s `owner != human_tag` guard + the scroll / rain floods: the XP economy assumes one book; the rain flood is LOCAL-only in retail.
6. **Records not yet mirrored but R-classified** (shield 0x4000, killer `f38`, shrine 0x1000, `mc2_rebound_precise` byte[0]&0x10 vs the port's chain/reap bit 0x10, `human_roll_0x20` on MC2 `f32`, `mc2_carpet_stall` byte[1]&8): bit-mapping collisions need checking before the record becomes authoritative.

---

## Slice 5c status (10-14) — every seat is a first-class human

- **Walkers read humans off their records.** The `MobCtx` `p*` lanes are no longer "the human": every walker reads
  the seat it means through `Gen::seat_at / seat_yaw / seat_dead / seat_dead_top / seat_purse(ctx, hx)` (the ctx's own
  seat reads exactly as before; any other seat reads his record). Switch: `MGC_NO_HUMAN_ROSTER_READ`. The `p*` lanes
  survive only as (a) the record-less fallback of unit rigs and the pre-record load settle, and (b) two deliberate
  phase views a caller hands in: the carpet's own warp-peek probe (`regen_boost` → `player_overlap_at`) and the
  load settle's marker pose. The wake pre-pass takes every seat's reference pose (`*_awake_pass_refs`).
- **Seat resolution per site**: a walker holding a target resolves its seat (`hx_of_tag`); a scan judges every seat
  (off-roster seats ahead of the walk, on-roster seats at their own record via `hx_of_rec`); area writers, the quake
  and the whirlwind run their human arm per seat (`WwSeat`); `MailTarget::Player(Hx)` carries the seat. Retail's
  `Entities[playerIndex]` reads (doomsday pyramid, MC2 stage engine + speech ramp, level-start checkpoint, cave drip,
  hydra blast-sound listener) answer to `Gen::local_seat()` (seat 0).
- **The turn**: `World::tick_inner(&mut [SeatTurn])` — seat-only blocks loop the seats in order, global blocks run
  once, each seat's carpet dispatches at its own record's walk slot. `World::tick_flight_seats`,
  `Simulation::step_seats(&[FlightInput])` (one `FlightInput` per seat). `single_hx()` is retired.
- **Seating**: `World::add_human_seat(colour)` before `seat_mc1_wizards` / `seat_mc2_wizards`;
  `Simulation::with_world` sizes the flight tier to the world's seats.
- **Save**: `SNAPSHOT_VERSION` 30 — identity carries the seat count, every per-seat lane is written per seat.
- **Tests**: `crates/mgc-sim/tests/mp_two_seats.rs` (a second seat flies; determinism; one-seat `step_seats` ≡ `step`;
  two-seat save round trip; seat count is identity).
- **Open (not wired)**: the app is single-seat (`LOCAL_HX`) — there is no N-human input path yet (no networking, ruled
  CLI-only); MP-only retail rules (e.g. the scroll's 50-XP MP grant) are not modelled.

## Castle per seat (10-14 #3)

- **`World::player_castle()` is retired.** It returned the lowest-numbered live (3,2) owned by ANY human, so with two
  humans seat 1 read seat 0's castle. Every caller now names its seat: `World::seat_castle(hx)` (the per-seat pool
  scan) — at-castle regen probes, the demolish, the ladder-sync price, the respawn anchor, the castle-spell price and
  canSummon pool probe, `mc2_afford`, the lock release, the stage-0 objective row, autofire's pool gate and the
  `castle_scan` conformance lane. The register readers' kill-switch arms (`player_castle_bound`,
  `mc2_demolish_castle`, `mc2_teleport_castle`, `mc2_price_castle`) fall back to the SEAT's scan.
- **The castle-spell locks are per seat**: `castle_lock_active(hx)` / `castle_build_lives(hx)` (MC1) and
  `mc2_castle_lock_active(hx)` / `mc2_castle_ball_aloft(hx)` (MC2) test only that seat's ball, token and castle — one
  human's castle mid-transform no longer fizzles another's Create Castle.
- **The doomsday pyramid / citadel devour** measures the castle-build shot against `playerIndex`'s castle
  (`seat_castle(local_seat())`), as retail does.
- One seat: the seat's tag is the only human tag, so every scan is the same scan — corpus byte-identical. Unit test
  `each_seat_resolves_its_own_castle`.

## The MobCtx human lanes retired (10-14 #3)

- `MobCtx` now carries only `phx` (the seat the walk serves) and the world's rule flags (`strict`, `patches`,
  `mc2_turn`). The tick-top copy of each human — pose, heading, purse, ceiling, life sign and the tick-top death
  latch — lives in `Gen::seat_view[hx]` ([`SeatView`], hash-silent, not on the wire), seeded at the tick top and
  re-published at the same phase points as before (the carpet's own slot, the warp and respawn peeks, the below-carpet
  view, `ctx_from_record`). Every seat has one, so `seat_dead_top(hx)` no longer special-cases the ctx's seat.
- Readers go through `Gen::view(hx)` / `view_mut(hx)` (and `World::view` / `view_mut`). The record stays the
  authoritative source; the view is the record-less fallback, the switch arms' restore and the two deliberate phase
  views (carpet warp-peek probe, wake pre-pass reference).
- Test rigs: the ctx helpers take the `Gen` they serve and write its seat view (`ctx_at(&mut g, px, py, …)`).
- Gate: 122/122 identical; 4 kill switches (`MGC_NO_HUMAN_ROSTER_READ`, `_RECORD_MIRROR`, `_LIVE_PURSE`,
  `_CTX_FROM_RECORD`) × 4 takes byte-identical old vs new binary (`_RECORD_MIRROR` moves both MC1 takes off the
  default, so the view path is exercised); 1577 tests; 633/633.

## Retail MP-only rules — census (10-14, read-only decompile sweep)

MP flag: MC2 `setting_byte1_22 & 0x10` (41 `MULTIPLAYER_MODE` tests + raw `& 0x10` at EF:38959; remc2's own
post-2026-07 additions — `MatchScore*`, `DestroyPlayerCastle`, WINDY cheat, EF:31445/31455/37587/37629/37641/37707/
37741/37771/38286 — are NOT retail). MC1/HW `str_AE408->var_u8_0 & 0x10` (18 tests + `&0x110` at :52110/:54568),
identical in both binaries; local node = `str_AE400->var_u16_8`, seat count = `var_u16_10`.

**MC2 sim-affecting (SP arm → MP arm):**
1. EF:40374 awake pre-pass `sub_68BF0` → skipped (everything awake). Port: always runs.
2. EF:41446-55 scroll XP 4 + `sub_6DB50` → **50** + `sub_6DBD0` (local seat only). Port: 4 only.
3. EF:40981/54677/41196 objectives evaluate row 0 → rows 0..NumberOfPlayers-1.
4. EF:40841 `InitStages`: map stages → ONE stage type 8 (last wizard standing) for all 8 rows.
5. EF:38449 `sub_53160` non-local seats AI → none AI; seats ≥ node count never spawn (EF:37825 and the other
   count-bounded walkers).
6. EF:39688 NumberOfPlayers = map value → node count.
7. EF:38437 carried book copied in → skipped.
8. EF:38959 wizard spell row = own seat → row 0 for everyone.
9. EF:38988 human spell levels floored to the map's level (≤2), XP = xpos2+1.
10. EF:39016 starting spells from the carry → from the map's StartingSpells.
11. EF:58570 per-cast relevel `sub_6D9C0` (xpos1, every wizard) → `sub_6DAD0` (xpos2, +1 step, LOCAL wizard only).
12. EF:44277/44300 `sub_6DB50` relevel ↔ `sub_6DBD0` swap roles.
13. EF:40759 cave drip: every 8th turn, seat 0 → every tick, extra LCG step, seat = rand % NumberOfPlayers.
14. EF:37332 type-31 switch (hidden-level entrance) → never created.
15. EF:37928-41 castle-less respawn request: lost + level over → "banished": wizard killed, spell entities removed,
    seat inactive (level > 24: local `byte[2] |= 0x10`). Also leave/banish cases 2/0x1D (EF:37881/38069).
16. EF:40167/40182 disk checkpoint save/restore → none. EF:40132 scroll census → skipped.

**MC1/HW sim-affecting:** A :52324 awake pre-pass skipped · B :49153 no AI seats · C :49201 spell row 0 for all ·
D :49231 human book = map allowed ∧ pregrant (no carry) · E :51536 seat count = node count · F :52110 **no
mana-goal win** · G :48623 castle-less respawn → banished · H :48603/:48607 checkpoint keys ignored.

UI/net-only (not sim): XP bar thresholds, objective speech/box, mana-goal tick marks, colour/name permutation, pause /
speed / save-load / `r` cheat SP-only, fly assistant forced off, menu FMVs skipped.

⚠ Several MP arms are keyed to the LOCAL node (scroll XP, per-cast relevel, banish flag) — in retail each node
credits only itself; a one-sim port must decide whether to apply them per seat.
